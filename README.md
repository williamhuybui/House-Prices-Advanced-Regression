# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression

**Status** Completed

## Project description
If you want to buy a house in Ames, Iowa, give me as much details of your dream house as you can. I will give you the price estimation of the house with a very high accuracy (the score is in top 7% on Kaggle)!

## Technology

Python: pandas, numpy, sklearn, and other smaller libraries
Tableau

## Visualization
I created a EDA on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/huy.bui#!/vizhome/HousePricesRegression/Story1?publish=yes)

## Data
The 2010 data consists of 1460 houses with prices. Each house has 79 features, which describe (almost) all of the aspect of a house. 

In the folder, there are train set and test set. The train set is where I train my model and the test set is what is submitted on kaggle. 

The folder also contains the "data description" file since there are a lot of features with categories.

There is also a powerpoint in which I presents the project on the executive level.

# Challenges
The hardest part of this project is feature engineer. Especially, there are many features that have nan values and categorical data. Filling in the data requires domain knowledge which I had to consult with the community on kaggle discussion.

# Future work
The model can be reused for a more updated version of the data

It would be interesting to see how listing prices change over time
